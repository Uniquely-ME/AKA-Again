My website is for a hair salon called A Kut Above. The website will have information based on the services and information based on the salon. It was very difficult for us to create certain items and have on our website correctly. I honestly wish we had more time and we gathered our information since the very beginning.   -Kiya Garmon




The README file is only for the code to tell the judges about your code. For example, if you do not like the colors, you would tell them that you would have chosen another color but those were the colors the clients liked and/or wanted.   -Ashley Crump
